Hang With Me
======
A multiplayer hang-man guessing game, using the Meteor Framework.

[View Demo](http://hangwithme.meteor.com/)

Framework used
------

 - Meteor Framework, an ultra-simple environment for building modern websites. Encorporates simple templating, latency compensation between multiple clients and a server and live HTML that is updated reactively as data changes.
 - www.meteor.com for more info

***Other technologies include:***
 - Node.js
 - MongoDB
 - Handlebars templating library
 - jQuery
 - HTML5
 - CSS3

Requirements
------
Install Meteor framework; see http://docs.meteor.com/

Other Ideas
------
 - Difficulty modes (choose from different dictionaries?)
 - Leaderboard (would require persisted players and games, and login; should still allow anonymous play, maybe prompt for register at the end)
 - Mobile compatibility
