<h1>Hang With Me

A multiplayer hang-man guessing game, using the Meteor Framework.

[View Demo](http://hangwithme.meteor.com/)

<h2>Framework used:</h2>

 - Meteor Framework, an ultra-simple environment for building modern websites. Encorporates simple templating, latency compensation between multiple clients and a server and live HTML that is updated reactively as data changes.

 <h3>Other technologies include:</h3>
 
 - Node.js
 - MongoDB
 - Handlebars templating library
 - jQuery
 - HTML5
 - CSS3

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
    Install Meteor framework; see http://docs.meteor.com/

<h2>Road Map</h2>
<h3>Iteration One (completed):</h3>
 - Single Player
 - Randomly generated word
 - No Hangman image (only number of guesses left)

<h3>Iteration Two (completed):</h3>
 - Two player mode - both players race to guess random word

<h3>Iteration Three (completed):</h3>
 - HTML5 hangman image that updates with incorrect guesses

<h3>Other Ideas:</h3>
 - Difficulty modes (choose from different dictionaries?)
 - Leaderboard (would require persisted players and games, and login; should still allow anonymous play, maybe prompt for register at the end)
 - Mobile compatibility
